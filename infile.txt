 The most popular approach is embedding layers you add an extra layer to your network which assigns a vector to each value of the categorical feature During training the network learns the weights for the different layers including those embeddings Most importantly learning the embeddings as part of the network increases the models complexity by adding many weights to the model which means youll need much more labeled data in order to learn The simplest way is to take embeddings of several items and look at their neighbors Are they similar in your domain That can be pretty exhausting and doesnt give you the big picture Sometimes we can get great results simply by taking some existing method but applying it to something new This paragraph contains several useful facts It would be great if a computer could read this text and understand that London is a city London is located in England London was settled by Romans and so on But to get there we have to first teach our computer the most basic concepts of written language and then move up from there We have given the neural network the task of predicting neighbours But we havent specified how the network should predict it So the neural network figures out an hidden representation of the words to aid it in the task of predicting neighbouring words Predicting neighbouring words is not an interesting task in itself We care about this hidden representation He said he was most concerned that children and others could be injured now that it reaches the ground The downtown area is also residential and there are homes that stand a few feet from the border fence None of that matters now You picked up that call and you regret it You want to shriek Dont call me again I dont care who you are Just go away Your words would fall on deaf ears There is no one on the other end and if you breathe a word your voice may be recorded for future use Also political organizations charities and survey takers are still permitted to call you Businesses youve bought something from or made a payment to in the last 18 months have a right to call When they call however firmly tell them to take you off their list and they have to honor your request although they might still try to talk you into reconsidering Another great feature of Truecaller is its ability to block spam calls When a pesky telemarketer calls there will be a big warning in red telling you that its a spam call Just swipe up when this happens to automatically block that caller and add them to the spam list
